## The outside Springfestval

I have been planned to take a vacation outside during the 2016 SpringFestval,and I did it.I spend a vacation with Lily Bai at Sanpan.

That is a beatuiful place. There are a lot of enthusiastic people around. I found that they smiled from the inside. I have been be jealous of them at first, But 
I bacame more and more happy grandually. In fact, it is hard to be unhappy when having the delicious food, watching the pure blue sea, breeing the mild wind from the sea,
looking at the sky full of stars, watching the sunset at a spa.

That is a wonderful vacation, thats a pretty place. I have had a feeling of freedom when I flied in the sky.

I have had thought a lot with the old days , the boring things. I set myself in trouble, in the bad things. What a shame to waste life, waste time.I am so luck that I realized that finally.

Never to be too late.

I am so lucky to have a friend which is so real and caring about me. I will try mybest to keep the friendship.

I found a lot of fun. I tried something new. I met somebody nice. I had fantastic lunch and dinner and wonderful icecream. 

I found myself. 


## The message form the old days

The message form the old days was the past. I should move on.

## Be confident and pretty

Be serious to work.

Be nice to others.

Be kind when I can.

Be confident and pretty.

Holding my head high will make me strong little by little.

Better Than the Gap.
